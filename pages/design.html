                        <p>Wherever we look, design is what provides the visual interest. From the bold and dramatic, to
                        the soft and subdued, design creates an emotion that draws our attention.

                        <h3>7 Elements of Design</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Elements of Design are used when creating art. They are the foundation that allows an artist to
                            beautify their art piece. These elements can be used in combination, or by themselves. Their use
                            surrounds us and can be found in nature, architecture and products we use on a daily basis. </p>
                        <hr />
                        <p><strong>Space</strong> is the area around, between or within It is either positive (white or light), or negative
                            (black or dark. The use of space creates the illustion of dimension and depth by placing objects
                            in layers of different sizes. White space provides an are around an objectâ€™s space to give the
                            eye rest. Dark space creates depth.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Line</strong> is fundamental in design to define edges, divide space and decorate. it is used to show
                            contour, gestures, expressions and to separate objects in an art piece. Line can be straight,
                            curved, thick or thin. Line also provides shading to create depth and shadow through small short
                            strokes call hatch strokes.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Color</strong> is a key element in design that creates a certain look and feel to the
                            art piece. Color is broken down into hue, the spectrum of a color wheel. Intensity refers to the
                            brightness and strength of the hue. Value is the darkness or lightness of the hue.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Value</strong> is the lightness or darkness of color. Regardless of whether an art piece
                            is done in black and white or color will contain value. However, value is critical in black and
                            white for it to succeed. The varying shades of black, grey and white allows the eye to see
                            dimension and form.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Form</strong> relates to objects that are three-dimensional and has length, width and
                            height. Form is different from shape. Shape is two dimensional. Form also provides cohesion of
                            the elements in how the elements unite.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Shape</strong> is two dimensional and flat. It contains only height and width. Shapes
                            can be organic with curves and free form. Organic shapes will have less-defined outlines. Shapes
                            can also be geometric with  precise and defined outlines. Tools can be used to create geometric
                            shapes, whereas organic shapes are usually created by free hand.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Texture</strong> provides visual interest and depth. Texture can either be natural,
                            where it can be felt on a three dimensional object, or implied to provide the look of texture
                            on a two dimensional or flat surface. Texture can be created to provide a visual illusion of
                            what an object would feel like. The use of illusional texture provides depth on a flat surface
                            creating visual stimulation and appeal.

                        <h3>8 Principles of Design</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Principles of Design are the structural elements used in art to organize the design. These
                            principles are applied to objects within the design. The success or failure of a design can be
                            tied to the artistâ€™s ability in understanding how to apply the principles of design into their
                            artwork.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <p><strong>Emphasis</strong> is a focal element of a design. Emphasis directs hierarchy. When
                            emphasis is used, the eye is directed to the predominate part of the design and then is directed
                            to the supporting elements of the design. Emphasis can be used in correlation with contrast,
                            color and line.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Rhythm</strong> is used in harmony with pattern. It is the repetition of line, shape and color that
                            provides unity to the design. Rhythm also helps to organize the design and can be accomplished
                            in regular or irregular rhythm. Regular rhythm uses repetition in an even or slightly even pattern.
                            Irregular rhythm uses repetition in an uneven manner. Both provide visual interest.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Pattern</strong> is the use of repetition to provide visual stimulation and appeal.
                            Pattern is accomplished using line, shape and color in repetition. Pattern is achieved in
                            various formats that harmonize with emphais and movement.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Contrast</strong> provides visual interest and excitement in art. It refers to varying
                            difference in color, value, shape, size and texture. The use of light and dark, black and white
                            creates the strongest contrast elements in art. Having contrasting and dissimilar objects in a
                            design stimulates the eye and assists in creating dimension.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Balance</strong> relates to objects and how they are arranged. Balance can be symmetrical,
                            with both sides equal and similar. It can also be asymmetrical where both sides are different
                            from each other. Balance can also be used radially where the use of line and shapes draws the
                            eye to a focal point.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Unity</strong> allows the art of design to have a sense of completeness. All
                            the elements of the design work together in harmony. Unity combined with variety creates visual
                            visual appeal. Together, they are the finishing touches of design.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Variety</strong> draws the eye into the design to obtain more information. When there is
                            variety in the design, there is visual interest. If there is no variety of color, tones, hues or
                            objects the design will look flat.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Movement</strong> allows the viewer to journey through the design. It can show action
                            and motion. Using value, the eye can be directed towards a smaller part of the design that would
                            normally go unnoticed. Movement is a supporting element of emphasis. </p>

                        <p>Working in a monochromatic color palette, the value is an essential element. The use of line, texture
                        and contrast are amongst the elements and principles used in this design.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>This design was achieved through layering. I began with creating a background texture. Next I placed
                        my photography photo of a silver mannequin. On top of the mannequin I played with several cracked layers.
                        Using some photoshop techniques, I masked out part of the upper layers to make the mannequin appear
                        as if she is breaking through what has tried to hold her back. The final touch was the tear of joy
                        that gently falls from her cheek, she has overcome.</p>

                        and space helps give this design dimension.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>This design was achieved by creating the sky background using a cloud brush. Upon this layer, the
                        grass and flowers were created. Next came the various cloud layers, causing the sun to peak out
                        behind the white clouds to show that the sun always shines after the storm. The final touch was
                        to create the butterfly, to indicate a renewal that occurs when we never fear facing the storms of live.</p>

                        <p>Creating an "edgy" design is speculative of personal artistic choice. Line, texture and value is heavily used in this
                        piece. </p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>This piece was created by developing the foundation layer of texture. I incorporated vector images made
                        in Illustrator into Photoshop to provide detail and visual interest. The final step was go create another
                        layer of texture to provide the effects on and around the skull. This design symbolically represents the
                        embracing the failure as a learning experience that will help us to succeed on a greater level. Success
                        comes through focus, hard work and learning from failures.  </p>
